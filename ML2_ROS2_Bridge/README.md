# Magic Leap 2 & ROS2 Integration Guide

This folder contains everything needed to interface the Magic Leap 2 headset with a ROS2 system.

Specifically, there are two approaches:

1. **Sensor Streaming (Camera & IMU):**
   If you need the Magic Leap 2 to send camera and IMU data to ROS2, the application is already ready. You simply need to follow the instructions in the `ROS2_development` folder to set up the ROS2-side interface and install the application provided in the `ML2_development` folder onto the headset.

2. **Custom Development & Extended Features:**
   If, however, you require additional features or need the headset to perform tasks other than just sending data, you can start with the Magic Leap 2 Unity project, using the scripts found in the `ML2_development` folder and following the instructions in the README located within that same folder. 
   
   Specifically, the provided code handles the functionality of the application we developed, serving as a starting point for you to add the features you need. Before proceeding with this approach, however, you must still follow the instructions in the `ROS2_development` folder to set up the ROS2-side interface.
